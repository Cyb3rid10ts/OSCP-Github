Hello All,
	This GitHub Repo is to save all my documents for OSCP/Hacking Training. I have some projects in different
	lanuages within the Programs for hacking. There is also a PWK-OSCP folder that is used with the PWK lab 
	enviroment. Some Wordlists are also attached. As time goes on I will be added more and more stuff to this
	repo. Please feel free to fork or steal some stuff from me and any help would be very much appreciated!
